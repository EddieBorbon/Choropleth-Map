# Choropleth Map Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Choropleth Map** that visualizes the educational attainment across the United States. It displays the percentage of the population aged 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher (2010-2014) by county. The map is interactive, allowing users to hover over counties to see detailed information.

The project was developed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/).
